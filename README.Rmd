# tidyfast

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `tidyfast` is to provide fast and efficient alternatives to some `tidyr` functions, including:

- `nest_dt()` for nesting data tables
- `unnest_dt()` for unnesting data tables
- `unnest_vec_dt()` for unnesting vectors in a list-column in a data table

Package is still in active development.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("TysonStanley/tidyfast")
```
## Example

This will be added soon.
